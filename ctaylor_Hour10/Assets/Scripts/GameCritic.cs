/* Q1. Is the game too easy or too hard? A1. The game is pretty easy, the balls can even go 
 * into their correct goals by themselves sometimes,
 * Q2.What would make it easier or harder? A2. You could make the goals move 
 * themselves so its harder for the balls to get into.
 * Q3. What would give it a 'WOW" factor? A3. Adding in music and sound/visual effect would make the game pop more.
 * Q4. What parts of the game are fun? What parts are tedious? A4. The chaotic nature of the game make it pretty fun,
 * as the chaos balls can make the goal balls get sent flying elsewhere. The collision on the bumper can sometimes not work so thats tedious. */
/* Things ive changed to the game- Added a restart button, game timer, changed the basic bumper to look like a car 
 * and i made it more complex with different shapes */
