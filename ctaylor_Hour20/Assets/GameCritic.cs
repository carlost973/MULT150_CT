 1. Game was a little too easy, the power ups were too plentiful and the obstacle were easy to dodge
 2.I would make the powers up show less frequently and the obstacls faster and more p;entiful. 
 3.A nice synthwave soundtrack and in  my case saw blade sound effects and some sort of alien power up sound.
 4.The longer you go the harder it is too focus which is kinda fun. The phase ability is cool too.
 5.How slow the game is and how even slower you are when you get hit.

I changed the asset of the obstacle into a saw blade and changed the partciles to make them chnage color in its lifetime and added a trail effect as well.
